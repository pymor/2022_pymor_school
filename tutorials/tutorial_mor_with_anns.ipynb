    "# Tutorial: Model order reduction with artificial neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent success of artificial neural networks led to the development of several\n",
    "methods for model order reduction using neural networks. pyMOR provides the\n",
    "functionality for a simple approach developed by Hesthaven and Ubbiali in {cite}`HU18`.\n",
    "For training and evaluation of the neural networks, [PyTorch](<https://pytorch.org>) is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will learn about feedforward neural networks, the basic\n",
    "idea of the approach by Hesthaven et al., and how to use it in pyMOR.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feedforward neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim at approximating a mapping {math}`h\\colon\\mathcal{P}\\rightarrow Y`\n",
    "between some input space {math}`\\mathcal{P}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^p` (in our case the\n",
    "parameter space) and an output space {math}`Y\\subset\\mathbb{R}^m` (in our case the\n",
    "reduced space), given a set {math}`S=\\{(\\mu_i,h(\\mu_i))\\in\\mathcal{P}\\times Y: i=1,\\dots,N\\}`\n",
    "of samples, by means of an artificial neural network. In this context, neural\n",
    "networks serve as a special class of functions that are able to \"learn\" the\n",
    "underlying structure of the sample set {math}`S` by adjusting their weights.\n",
    "More precisely, feedforward neural networks consist of several layers, each\n",
    "comprising a set of neurons that are connected to neurons in adjacent layers.\n",
    "A so called \"weight\" is assigned to each of those connections. The weights in\n",
    "the neural network can be adjusted while fitting the neural network to the\n",
    "given sample set. For a given input {math}`\\mu\\in\\mathcal{P}`, the weights between the\n",
    "input layer and the first hidden layer (the one after the input layer) are\n",
    "multiplied with the respective values in {math}`\\mu` and summed up. Subsequently,\n",
    "a so called \"bias\" (also adjustable during training) is added and the result is\n",
    "assigned to the corresponding neuron in the first hidden layer. Before passing\n",
    "those values to the following layer, a (non-linear) activation function\n",
    "{math}`\\rho\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}` is applied. If {math}`\\rho`\n",
    "is linear, the function implemented by the neural network is affine, since\n",
    "solely affine operations were performed. Hence, one usually chooses a\n",
    "non-linear activation function to introduce non-linearity in the neural network\n",
    "and thus increase its approximation capability. In some sense, the input\n",
    "{math}`\\mu` is passed through the neural network, affine-linearly combined with the\n",
    "other inputs and non-linearly transformed. These steps are repeated in several\n",
    "layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure shows a simple example of a neural network with two hidden\n",
    "layers, an input size of two and an output size of three. Each edge between\n",
    "neurons has a corresponding weight that is learnable in the training phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} neural_network.png\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the neural network, one considers a so called \"loss function\", that\n",
    "measures how the neural network performs on the training set {math}`S`, i.e.\n",
    "how accurately the neural network reproduces the output {math}`h(\\mu_i)` given\n",
    "the input {math}`\\mu_i`. The weights of the neural network are adjusted\n",
    "iteratively such that the loss function is successively minimized. To this end,\n",
    "one typically uses a Quasi-Newton method for small neural networks or a\n",
    "(stochastic) gradient descent method for deep neural networks (those with many\n",
